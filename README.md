Low-Level Design (LLD) Exploration
Welcome to my Low-Level Design (LLD) exploration repository! In this repo, I am diving deep into various LLD topics, practices, and principles that help in building clean, modular, and scalable software systems.

I will be exploring multiple areas within LLD, focusing on key design patterns, best practices, and principles for developing efficient and maintainable code.

What is Low-Level Design (LLD)?
Low-Level Design is the phase where we transform high-level system designs into detailed designs for individual components and modules. It involves breaking down the system into smaller, more manageable units and specifying their behavior, data flow, and interaction with other components. LLD is essential for ensuring that a system is efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain.

Key Topics Explored:
Here are some of the key topics I will be covering in this repo:

SOLID Principles: Exploring core object-oriented design principles that ensure maintainable and scalable code.

S: Single Responsibility Principle

O: Open/Closed Principle

L: Liskov Substitution Principle

I: Interface Segregation Principle

D: Dependency Inversion Principle

Design Patterns: Implementing common solutions to recurring design problems (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.).

Class & Object Design: Best practices for designing reusable and maintainable classes and objects.

API Design: How to design clear, efficient, and scalable APIs for your application.

Data Flow Design: Understanding how data flows between components and how to manage it efficiently.

Error Handling & Security: Implementing robust error handling and securing sensitive data.

Database Schema Design: Structuring databases to handle complex systems effectively.

Concurrency and Threading: Approaches to handling concurrent tasks in multi-threaded environments.

Why is LLD Important?
Scalability: Proper LLD ensures that the system can grow smoothly as requirements evolve.

Maintainability: A well-defined LLD makes the system easy to maintain, modify, and debug.

Testability: Clear designs lead to more manageable and testable components.

Flexibility: Systems designed with LLD principles are more adaptable to change.
